Just a weekly progress update. This is the first time this app has ever looked like a game. 
Landing on top of coins isn't exactly intentional, and the physics need tweaking, and every curved surface is just a rectangular block you run into...

But progress is progress.

Hot new features:

- Jumping
- Not exploding into space when attempting to move
- A reset button

Dare I say GOTY 2017?
