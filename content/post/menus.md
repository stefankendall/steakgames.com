While I've been grinding and grinding on movement development, I wired up some neat menus for testing.

Super neat.

<p>With a fast level selector, I should be able to test movement in more 
and varied environments quite a bit quicker. I thought I could figure 
this out on a test level or two, but that's just not the case. 
As it turns out, movement is really, really hard to get right.</p>

I have some ideas for how I can make this into something that's not blander than wheat-bran, but it needs testing. Lots and lots of testing.
